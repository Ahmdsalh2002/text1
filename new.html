    <p>fast car on the world... The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH[7] and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron,[8] the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016.[9][10] The car is based on the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car.

        The car is named after the Mon√©gasque driver Louis Chiron.[11] The car shares the name with the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car.
        
        In January 2022, it was announced that every Chiron had been sold. As of January 2022, some of these sold vehicles still need to be physically manufactured and delivered to their owners.[1]</p>
